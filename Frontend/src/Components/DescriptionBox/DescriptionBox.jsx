          An e-commerce website is an online platform that facilitates the
          buying and selling of products or services over the internet. It
          serves as a virtual storefront where businesses and individuals can
          showcase their products, interact with customers, and conduct
          transactions without the need for a physical presence. E-commerce
          websites have gained immense popularity due to their convenience,
          accessibility, and the global reach they offer.

          E-commerce websites typically display products or services along with
          detailed descriptions, images, prices, and customer reviews. Shopping
          cart functionality allows users to add items for purchase, and secure
          payment gateways facilitate online transactions.
